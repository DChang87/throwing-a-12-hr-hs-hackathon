#Sponsorship Prospectus
Creating a sponsorship prospectus is important for your sponsor hunt because it'll give them an idea of what you are offering in exchange for their sponsorship.

###Ideal Prospectus
- 3 tiers
  - bronze, silver and gold
  - mega, giga and tera
  - etc.
  - could create an extra tier for Co-Hosting
- should be flexible for sponsors to negotiate
- should be in the format of a chart so the sponsors could compare the perks with the different tiers
