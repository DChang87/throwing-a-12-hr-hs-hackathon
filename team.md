#Organizing Team

Depending on the size of your organizing team, one person may need to take on more than one of these jobs.

Depending on the people, it may also be a good idea to have two of some of these following positions (ex. two Heads of Outreach). It's, for the most part, easier to have maximum one person per task so he/she is responsible for the task.


####Director
- Should overlook the planning of the entire event
- Ensure that everyone else is doing his/her job
- Fill-in for anything that isn't done/done properly by the other organizers

####Head of Outreach


####Head of Activities


####Head of Workshops
