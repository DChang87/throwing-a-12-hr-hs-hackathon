#Organizing Team

Depending on the size of your organizing team, one person may need to take on more than one of these jobs.

Depending on the people, it may also be a good idea to have two of some of these following positions (ex. two Heads of Outreach). It's, for the most part, easier to have maximum one person per task so he/she is responsible for the task.

####Director
- Should overlook the planning of the entire event
- Ensure that everyone else is doing his/her job
- Fill-in for anything that isn't done/done properly by the other organizers
- **should be passionate about the event and have a strong heart**
- **should be ready to perform any of the following task**
- **soft and communication skills are very important**

####Head of Sponsorships
- This could be a 'head' job but it really should be done by **everyone** on the team
- create the sponsorship prospectus 
- send LOTS of emails out to companies
- finalize the sponsorship deals

####Head of Outreach
- Reach out to schools in the local area (preferably through the CS teachers although calling the school itself may work) to promote the event and get students outside of your school signed up
- Reach out to media (newspaper, TV, etc.) to gemerate awareness of the event
- **strong communication skills needed**

####Head of Creativity
- Will design the logo, banners and posters for the event
